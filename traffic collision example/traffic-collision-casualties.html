        <h1>Traffic Collision Casualties in Alberta (2001 - 2014)</h1>
        <h4>By Indratmo</h4>
        <h2>Has traffic safety improved in Alberta?</h2>

        <p>To answer this question, I explored the Edmonton's Open Data Portal and found a
            <a href="https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/traffic-collision-casualties-alberta">dataset</a> on traffic
            collision casualties in Alberta from 2001 to 2014. The dataset breaks down the total number of casualties
            into two categories: killed or injured.
        </p>
        <p>
            As can be seen in the graph, most of traffic collision casualties involve injuries. Over the years, there
            has been a significant reduction in the number of injuries and the total number of casualties. From 28,000
            in 2001 down to 19,000 in 2014. These numbers indicate that there has been an improvement in traffic
            safety, especially considering that there are more vehicles on the roads now than 15 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in terms of the number of people killed on the roads, the numbers are still up and down over the
            years, ranging from 320 to 460. With the City of Edmonton already adopted the
            <a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/traffic_safety/vision-zero.aspx">Vision Zero</a>, we should
            work together to reduce the number of fatalities and severe injuries to zero.
